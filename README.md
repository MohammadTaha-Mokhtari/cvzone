# cvzone
This project utilizes OpenCV and cvzone libraries to demonstrate various computer vision techniques for real-time hand, face, and pose detection. The following modules from cvzone are used :

Hand Tracking : The HandDetector from the cvzone.HandTrackingModule is employed to detect and track hands in real-time.

Face Mesh : The FaceMeshDetector from the cvzone.FaceMeshModule is used to detect facial landmarks. It provides a mesh of key points on the face.

Face Detection : The FaceDetector from the cvzone.FaceDetectionModule detects faces in the video feed. This module ensures that the system can identify faces accurately.

Pose Detection : The PoseDetector from the cvzone.PoseModule is used to detect body poses and track movements. It identifies key body parts such as the hands, arms, and head.

Features: Real-time hand, face, and pose detection., Displaying landmarks and body keypoints., Gesture interaction with the detected objects.

Requirements: Python 3.x, OpenCV, cvzone.
